	attributes and methods useful for working with the progression.
	
	Available attributes are:
	chromaticSet    --- (0, 1, 2, ... 11)
	pitches         --- deque object containing the chromatic set minus
                       missingPitch

	nonLooping      --- the non-looping part of the progression. If the
                       progression lacks it, None
	loopingStart    --- the looping section of the progression
	
	Useful inherited methods are:
	original()          --- returns complete
	retrograde()        --- returns the retrograde of complete
	inverse()           --- returns the inverse of complete
	retrogradeInverse() --- returns the retrograde-inverse of complete
	transposition()     --- needs startPitch argument, and optionally
                           identitiy=\'original\'. Transposes to
                           startPitch.
