ROADMAP
=======


- Stage 1
	- Write documentation
		- README (DONE ).
		- ROADMAP (DONE).
		- License (DONE).
		- Coding conventions (ONGOING).
	- Code moebiusLib.Progression() basic methods and (generated) attributes.
		- Write an __init__() for the class. The init will invoke:
			- code processInitialConditions() (DONE)
			- code makeProgression() that will produce the tone progression. (DONE)
			- code nonLoopingNLoopingSections(), which will determine if the
				specific tone-row has a non-looping section. If so, make it
				available to the class through  the
				Progression.nonLoopingSection attribute. It will also determine
				the tone-row's looping section, and make it available to
				the class through  the Progression.loopingSection attribute. (DONE)
- Stage 2
	- Code moebiusLib.Progression() more sophisticaded methods
		(and attributes?).
		- code methods to generate the tone-row identities: retrograde, inverse
			and inverse-retrograde. Implement in a separate (super?) class,
			since the functionality has more general purpose applications. (DONE)
	- Code moebiusLib.Matrix() basic methods and (generated) attributes.
		- use moebiusLib.Progression() as super-class for Matrix() (Done)
		- Code makeTranspositionMatrix() which will construct a transposition
			matrix with the inverse tone-row as first notes for the subsequent
			transpositions. (DONE)
		- Add keyword argument to __init__() so that the
			originating tone-row can be an identity of Progression.complete.
		- Code makeInverseMatrix() which will construct a transposition
			matrix with the inverse tone-row as first notes for the subsequent
			transpositions. (DONE)
			- Add keyword argument to __init__ so that the matrix is generated
				from series identities. Originating Identities should also be
				possible. (DONE)
- Stage 3
	- Review the code (MOSTLY DONE)
		- Optimize if necessary.
		- Polish docstrings and comments if necessary.
	- Write any missing documentation.
- Stage 4 (wishlist)
	- Add methods to identify symetry and inversion axises in 
				Matrix.matrix.
	- Code moebiusLib.Progression() experimental methods (and attributes?).
		- add optional arguments to makeProgression() or __init__ in order to
			experiment with different modulos and/or constants in the iterated
			function (2x = y).
		- make experimental methods in order to iterate different formulae?
		- implement modular systems other than Twelve-tone equal temperament
			(TET).
	- Code moebiusLib.Matrix() more methods (and attributes?).
		- Add methods to retrieve basic statistical data from the generated Matrix
		(pitch mean, median and mode)
	- Code moebiusLib.Harmnoy() basic methods and (generated) attributes.
- Stage 5
	- Review the code
		- Optimize if necessary.
		- Polish docstrings and comments if necessary.
	- Write any missing documentation.
